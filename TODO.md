### TODO List:
* To implement:
    * Controllers for endpoints.
    <br>
   
    * Make the location where file properties are read from easily changeable.
    <br>
 
    * Abstract SQL syntax, so that it is closely used by the ConnectionObjects package implementation.
    <br>
 
    * Refactor any duplicate code in the services into the GeneralService, as it is clearly shared.

* To clean up / optimize:
    * Clean up service abstraction.
    <br>
    
    * The string formatting can be more closely used to abstract the sql syntax.
